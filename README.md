# M&A Challenge

A parent company called FlipFlop is in the final stages of acquiring StepToes AI and is looking to go through a Mergers and Acquisitions due diligence process 
with FOSSA as the compliance scanner. As an engineer, the execs at FlipFlop asked you to join a M&A kickoff call as part of your role at FOSSA. 
You meet with the StepToes AI engineers and are tasked with the following items:

Level I

- Prepare a “What is FOSSA?” presentation
  - Explain FOSSA and how it will engage as part of the due diligence process
- Sign up for FOSSA.
- Review FOSSA CLI documentation at https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli

Level II

- Based on the imaginary kickoff call above, FOSSA understands that StepToes AI has two major projects that need to be scanned. Help StepToes integrate their projects by using the FOSSA CLI.

Level III

- Review the results and determine any compliance risks
- Generate compliance reports from FOSSA, and prepare an explanatory presentation for both StepToes AI and FlipFlop (separate presentations)

Please complete as many items as you can. If you have any questions please reach out to chelsea@fossa.com
