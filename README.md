# M&A Challenge

A parent company called FlipFlop is in the final stages of acquiring StepToes AI and is looking to go through a Mergers and Acquisitions due diligence process 
with FOSSA as the compliance scanner. As an engineer, the execs at FlipFlop asked you to join a M&A kickoff call as part of your role at FOSSA. 
You meet with the StepToes AI engineers and are tasked with the following items:

### Level I

- Prepare a “What is FOSSA?” presentation.
  - Explain FOSSA and how it will engage as part of the due diligence process.
- Sign up for FOSSA.
- Review the FOSSA CLI documentation.

#### Resources
- [FOSSA CLI](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli)
- [FOSSA compliance documentation](https://docs.fossa.com/docs/running-a-scan)
- [FOSSA Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@getfossa/playlists)


### Level II

- Based on the imaginary kickoff call above, FOSSA understands that StepToes AI has two major projects that need to be scanned. They have distributed and non-distributed products, which are present in this exercise. Help StepToes scan their projects by using the FOSSA CLI.
  - For the `analyze` command, use the `--project` flag for each directory in this repository.

### Level III

- Review the results and determine any compliance risks.
- Generate compliance reports from FOSSA, and prepare an explanatory presentation for both StepToes AI and FlipFlop (separate presentations).
- Based on your learnings from this challenge, create collateral (written doc, slide deck presentation or video - your choice!) that you can send to a client, so that they can self-serve during an M&A!

Please complete as many items as you can, and have fun while you explore FOSSA's capabilities! If you have any questions please reach out to chelsea@fossa.com and deepak@fossa.com.
